Points:

1.	All the test cases cover the 100 percent code coverage. Even covering null.
2.	Implementing two append methods for String and Char also.
3.	Increase Capacity function is explicitly defined, so that in future any append method like int, double, float can use the same.
4.	As per performance, the default 16 char constructor is used, but defined the additional constructor for more than 16 char.
5.	Covered two non-equal test cases also, so not to trust the code blindly.
